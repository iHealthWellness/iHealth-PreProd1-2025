                            should be sent by email to onehealthconnectapp@gmail.com AND certified mail to: iHealth and Wellness Foundation, Inc., 115 Broadway St. Fl 5,New York,NY 10006, USA. 
                            Any Notice sent to you will be sent to the address on file for your account. The Notice must: (i) include your name and account number; (ii) describe the nature and
                            basis of the Dispute; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought. Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a dispute through an informal negotiation
                            within thirty (30) days from the date the Notice is sent. After that thirty (30) day period and not before, either party may commence arbitration. If we are not able
                            to resolve the Dispute by informal negotiation or, as provided below, in a small claims court, all Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding 
                            individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org) according to this 
                            Section and the Consumer Arbitration Rules through the Procedures for the Resolution of Disputes through Document Submission (the “AAA Rules”), including Rule 
                            D-3(b), except you and iHealth and Wellness Foundation, Inc. will have the right to file early or summary dispositive motions and so long as the claim is 
                            arbitrable under the AAA Rules. The Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether
                            these Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. 
                            Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long 
                            as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis.
